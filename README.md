A 3D model of a transient heat transfer model of a modular cube satellite.

How to get started:

Modify the config array to your desired setup, only 2D arrays are supported. 

Currently the sun and earth faces are static, so change them to the desired faces to be illuminated.

The cube sizes can be modified if desired, but are defaulted to 1 cm and 0.3 cm thick. If the thickness is changed, the edot will need to be modified.
